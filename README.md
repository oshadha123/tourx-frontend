# TourX

## Description

Project TourX aims to increase the visibility of lesser-known travel destinations within Sri Lanka and thereby attract more tourists to the country. The locations would be ones that are known only to locals of the area or known through word-of-mouth. Places to visit that are close by will be suggested, and the tourist can go through a virtual tour of the location to decide if they should go and to learn what to expect. Routing will be shown according to the tourist’s location, which can include paths that are unmapped on the maps API. Pictures used to create the virtual tours are to be uploaded by local tour guides. Tourists can rate the images and virtual tours, which will be used on a leaderboard of the tour guides. Guides with higher ratings will be recommended to tourists when they visit the relevant locations. Options to check weather information at a particular site, and a text-to-speech feature to translate into the local language will be provided by the system. The system shall also be able to provide its services to tour and travel booking sites.

### Goal

Give recognition to less well-known tourist attractions and attract more tourists to the country by providing them with visual information about those tourist attractions and suggesting pathways to travel to those destinations.

### Objectives

* Develop a tourist guiding mobile application for tourists in Sri Lanka and suggest tourist attractions in the vicinity including the ones that are less well-known by showing routing options from the tourist’s location to those tourist attractions and creating virtual tours for them.
* Provide weather information and options to translate between foreign tourists’ language and local languages.

## Database

Relational database (MySQL) is used as the database for it does not require any complex structuring or querying processes. Therefore, it is sufficient to be handled with simple SQL queries and also efficient at joining data across tables, making it easier to perform complex queries as well against structured data.
